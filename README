This is a superproject which contains all lxde-qt components.
After checking out this repo, please do the following to initialize git submodules.

> git submodule init
> git submodule update

Note:
There are some limitations of older versions of git.
Because git submodule does not track the latest HEAD automatically, the submodules always stick to specific commits
unless manually changed. Besides, after initial checkout, the submodule repos are detached from master branch.

Consider doing this manually to checkout master branches for every module.
> git submodule foreach git checkout master

To pull the latest changes for all modules at once, try this:
> git submodule foreach git pull --rebase

These restrictions no long applies to the latest git 1.8.x since it can be configured to track the latest changes in 
submodules automatically.
